# HTML5

In the previous section, we used `div` to organize content in blocks.

HTML5 is the fifth major version of HTML that added more attributes and semantic tags to the previous Living Standard HTML.

HTML5 is recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for web content.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">
    <head></head>
    <body></body>
</html>
```
